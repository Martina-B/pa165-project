13. Secret Service Archive

The web application is an archive of missions performed by agents of a secret service. It contains data about countries, missions, agents and reports from each agent from each mission. The data about countries are similar as the CIA World Factbook (google it up). Each mission targets a country, has some duration, objectives and needs some material resources (explosives, submarines etc.). Agents have personal data about their codenames, training, language skills, weapon skills etc. Agents are assigned to a mission for independent periods of time, thus the number of agents assigned to mission may change during its duration. A report about each assignment and an agentâ€™s performance evaluation is archived. The application also helps to find available agents that have previous experience with a country and have required skills for a planned mission.
